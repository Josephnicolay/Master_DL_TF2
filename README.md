Master Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 with Computer Vision,Natural Language Processing, Sound Recognition &amp; Deployment

Deep Learning is one of the most popular fields in computer science today. It has applications in many and very varied domains. With the publishing of much more efficient deep learning models in the early 2010s, we have seen a great improvement in the state of the art in domains like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Image Generation, and Signal Processing.

The demand for Deep Learning engineers is skyrocketing and experts in this field are highly paid, because of their value. However, getting started in this field isn’t easy. There’s so much information out there, much of which is outdated and many times don't take the beginners into consideration :(

In this course, we shall take you on an amazing journey in which you'll master different concepts with a step-by-step and project-based approach. You shall be using Tensorflow 2 (the world's most popular library for deep learning, and built by Google) and Huggingface. We shall start by understanding how to build very simple models (like Linear regression models for car price prediction, text classifiers for movie reviews, binary classifiers for malaria prediction) using Tensorflow and Huggingface transformers, to more advanced models (like object detection models with YOLO, lyrics generator model with GPT2 and Image generation with GANs)

After going through this course and carrying out the different projects, you will develop the skill sets needed to develop modern deep-learning solutions that big tech companies encounter.
